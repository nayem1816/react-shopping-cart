# React Shoppint Cart

A shopping cart project built with React is a web application that allows users to add and remove items from a virtual cart. The user can view the contents of the cart, change the quantity of items, and proceed to checkout. The project may also include features such as product search, filtering, and user authentication for saving cart items for future purchases. This application can be built using React.js, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and may use other technologies such as Redux for state management.
